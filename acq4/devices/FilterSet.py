class FilterSet(Device, OptomechDevice):
    """Represents an optical filter or filter set.

    This device class has two main purposes:  (1) Providing access to metadata
    about filters in the optical path between a light source and the sample. 
    (2) Providing access to metadata about filters in the optical path between
    an imaging device and the sample.

    FilterSets may be simple pass-through optics like an ND filter placed in front of
    a light source, or they may have multiple beam paths like in a dichroic filter cube.

    For swappable filters, see the FilterWheel class.

    Configuration examples::
